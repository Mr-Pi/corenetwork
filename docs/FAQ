core-netif differences
======================

In Funtoo Linux, the ``/etc/netif.d`` directory contains modular network configuration templates
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The modular template system allows for simpler, purpose-built network interface
configuration scripts to be created, rather than having a monolithic "one size
fits all" universal network script as in Gentoo and OpenRC.  These
lighter-weight network configuration scripts can be more easily read,
understood -- and modified if desired. This approach is much more extensible.

In Funtoo Linux, network interface configuration scripts are named ``netif.*`` rather than ``net.*``
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Funtoo Linux, ``/etc/init.d/net`` is a dummy script that serves a single purpose
-- to satisfy dependencies for all initscripts that ``need net``. Funtoo
network interface scripts are named ``/etc/init.d/netif.*``.  

In Funtoo Linux, network interfaces must be added to your default runlevel to be enabled.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. Note:: There is an exception from this rule, ``netif.lo`` which brings up loopback interface must be in ``boot`` runlevel.

Gentoo Linux has the unfortunate behavior of starting **all** network
interfaces and DHCP clients found in ``/etc/init.d`` when something needs
``net``, whether or not you've added these network interfaces or DHCP clients
to your current runlevel. This is due to the way the ``net`` initscript
dependency is implemented, and works against the elegant, modular runlevel
design of Gentoo and Funtoo initscripts. 

In Funtoo Linux, if you want a network interface to be started in a runlevel,
you must manually add it to that runlevel by typing::

        # rc-update add netif.eth0 default

This allows different runlevels to have different network interfaces enabled or
disabled.  In Funtoo Linux, ``dhcpcd`` also needs to be added to your current
runlevel in order to enable it::

        # rc-update add dhcpcd default

In Funtoo Linux, stopping a single network interface does not stop all network-dependent services.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Gentoo, if you stop ``net.eth0``, all network-dependent services will also
be stopped. In Funtoo Linux, by default it is safe to stop or restart ``netif.eth0``
or any other network interface. By default, network-dependent services will
keep running.

It is possible to modify this behavior in a very fine-grained way. Say that you
need ``netif.eth0`` to be up so that ``netmount`` can mount an NFS filesystem.
To do this, add the following line to ``/etc/conf.d/netmount``::

        rc_need="netif.eth0"

This will cause ``netmount`` to start ``netif.eth0`` prior to mounting the
remote NFS filesystem, and will cause ``netmount`` to be stopped if
``netif.eth0`` is stopped.  However, ``sshd``, which listens on all interfaces
and does not require a particular network interface to be "up", will remain
running even if ``netif.eth0`` is stopped.

If you would want ``netif.eth0`` to start before ``netmount`` starts, but don't
want the stopping or restarting of ``netif.eth0`` to cause ``netmount`` to
stop or restart, then you would do this::

        rc_use="netif.eth0"

This may not be useful for ``netmount``, which typically needs to maintain
persistent network connections, but may be useful for scripts that need to only
perform a short burst of network activity, such as one-time NTP time synchronization,
or if you would prefer a script like ``sshd`` to start after ``netif.eth0``
without a restart of ``netif.eth0`` causing ``sshd`` to also restart. The
``rc_after`` and ``rc_before`` settings can also be used for this purpose.
