Introduction
============

.. _Gentoo Linux: http://www.gentoo.org
.. _OpenRC: http://roy.marples.name/projects/openrc
.. role:: change

Funtoo Linux has its own core network configuration system that differs somewhat from
upstream network configuration systems used in `Gentoo Linux`_ and `OpenRC`_.
Despite this difference, Funtoo Linux remains compatible with upstream `Gentoo
Linux`_ and `OpenRC`_. 

In this document, I will explain the unique additions and changes to the Funtoo
network configuration and show you how to use this system to configure your
network.

I'll also explain how to use ``dhcpcd 5.x`` for managing network interfaces on
DHCP-based networks, and will also cover OpenRC stacked runlevel configuration,
*Wi-Fi* (IEEE 802.11) configuration, and the OpenResolv framework, which is
enabled in Funtoo Linux by default.

.. Note:: The Funtoo network configuration system is quite functional but is also something
  that I periodically improve and enhance as Funtoo Linux progresses in its
  development.

A Gentle Introduction to Funtoo Network Configuration
=====================================================

Before I get into the technical details of configuring your network, it's
important to understand that Funtoo Linux has a number of different options
available to you for network configuration, with more likely to be added in the
future. Each approach is different and has its own strengths and weaknesses,
and this is, in my opinion, a good thing.

The Easy (Dynamic) Way
----------------------

When configuring your network, one option is to skip traditional network
configuration and simply rely on DHCP. This is by far the simplest method of
configuring your network.  If you are on a wired network, no other steps are
typically required beyond enabling a DHCP client, and Funtoo Linux includes
``dhcpcd 5.x`` by default.  To enable DHCP at system startup, you would
add ``dhcpcd`` to your default runlevel as follows::

        # rc-update add dhcpcd default
       
To enable DHCP immediately, you would follow the previous command with an
``rc`` command, which would start the ``dhcpcd`` client you just added::

        # rc

If you're on a wired network and have the necessary drivers in your kernel,
then this should get you going. For wireless networks, more steps are required
which will be covered later in this document. For now, it's important to note
that ``dhcpcd 5.x`` will manage *all* available network interfaces by default,
although this behavior can be changed by editing ``/etc/conf.d/dhcpcd``.

The Modular Way
---------------

DHCP isn't always an option, and for these situations, Funtoo Linux offers its
own modular, template-based network configuration system. This system offers a
lot of flexibility for configuring network interfaces, essentially serving as a
"network interface construction kit." This system can be used by itself, or
even combined with ``dhcpcd`` -- if you limit ``dhcpcd`` to only manage certain
network interfaces.

Here are the key components of the template-based network configuration system:

0) ``/etc/init.d/netif.lo`` -- An init script that configures the localhost
   interface.

1) ``/etc/netif.d`` -- This is a directory that contains various network
   configuration templates. Each of these templates is focused on configuring
   a particular type of network interface, such as a general static IP-based
   interface, a bridge interface, a bond interface, etc.

2) ``/etc/init.d/netif.tmpl`` -- This is the master init script for the
   template-based network configuration system. New interfaces are added
   to your system by creating **symbolic links** to this file in ``/etc/init.d``.
    
So, if you wanted to use this system to configure ``eth0`` with a static
IP address, you would create a ``netif.eth0`` symlink to ``netif.tmpl``
as follows::

        # cd /etc/init.d
        # ln -s netif.tmpl netif.eth0

Then, you would create an ``/etc/conf.d/netif.eth0`` configuration file
that would specify which template to use from the ``/etc/netif.d``
directory::

        template="interface"
        ipaddr="10.0.1.200/24"
        gateway="10.0.1.1"
        nameservers="10.0.1.1 10.0.1.2"
        domain="funtoo.org"

When configuring your own static network interface, one of ``ipaddr`` or
``ipaddrs`` is required and should specify the IP address(es) to configure for
this interface, in "a.b.c.d/netmask" format. Optional parameters include
``gateway``, which defines a default gateway for your entire network, and if
set should specify the gateway's IP address. In addition, ``domain`` and
``nameservers`` (space-separated if more than one) can be used to specify DNS
information for this interface.

Configuration Variables
-----------------------

Interface Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following variables are supported by the ``interface`` and ``bridge``
templates:

- ``ipaddr`` or ``ipaddrs``: specify IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) for the interface.
  IP addresses should be specified in "IP/netmask" format, such as "10.0.0.1/24".
  Multiple IP addresses can be specified like this::

        ipaddrs="10.0.0.1/24 10.0.0.2/24"

Note that in some cases, you may choose to **not** specify ``ipaddr`` or
``ipaddrs`` for a ``bridge`` template. That is allowed. If you don't want to
specify an IP address for a regular interface, you can choose to use the 
``interface`` template without an IP address specified in the config, 
or use the ``interface-noip`` template instead, for the sake of clarity.

General Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following variables are enabled by default for all network scripts, and if
specified will trigger a corresponding configuration action:


- ``nameservers``: Set DNS nameservers using OpenResolv. Specify multiple nameservers
  like this: "1.2.3.4 1.2.3.5 1.2.3.6"

- ``domain``: Set DNS domain using OpenResolv.

- ``gateway``: Define a default gateway.

- ``mtu``: Set Maximum Transmit Unit for the interface

- ``slaves``: Set slave interfaces of this interface (for bridges, etc.)
  All slaves will automatically be depended upon, and will also automatically
  have their ``mtu`` set to that of the current interface, if an ``mtu`` is specified
  for the current interface.  This setting is required for the ``bond`` template
  and optional for the ``bridge`` template.

VLAN Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

VLAN support is enabled by default for all network configuration scripts. If
a network script has a name in the format ``netif.ethX.Y``, then it is assumed
to be a VLAN interface referencing trunk ``ethX`` and VLAN ID ``Y``. If you
desire a custom name for your VLAN interface, you can name your interface 
whatever you'd like and specify the following variables in your interface
config file:

- ``trunk``: VLAN trunk interface, e.g. "eth0"

- ``vlan``: VLAN id, e.g. "32"

.. Note:: More detailed information on VLAN configuration can be found below -
   See **Basic VLAN Configuration** and **Custom VLAN Names**.

OpenResolv and resolv.conf
--------------------------

For the network configuration above, OpenResolv will be used to set DNS
information when the ``netif.eth0`` is brought up. The OpenResolv framework
will add entries to ``/etc/resolv.conf``, and will also handle removing these
entries when the interface is brought down. This way, ``/etc/resolv.conf``
should always contain current information and should not need to be manually
edited by the system administrator. ``dhcpcd`` will use OpenResolv for
updating system DNS information as well.

Network-Dependent Services
--------------------------

One important difference between Gentoo Linux and Funtoo Linux is that, in Funtoo
Linux, network-dependent services only strictly depend on ``netif.lo``. This
means that if another network service requires an interface to be up, such as
``samba`` requiring ``eth0``, then the system administrator must specify this
relationship by adding the following line to ``/etc/conf.d/samba``::

        rc_need="netif.eth0"

This will have the effect of ensuring that ``netif.eth0`` is started prior
to ``samba`` and that ``samba`` is stopped prior to stopping ``netif.eth0``.

Many network services, especially those that listen on all network intefaces,
don't need an ``rc_need`` line in order to function properly. Avoiding the
use of ``rc_need`` when required will optimize boot times and allow more
network services to remain available when network interfaces are brought up
and down by the system administrator.

Multiple Network Configurations
-------------------------------

It is common for a laptop user to use DHCP most of the time; however, they
may also need to periodially connect to network where a static network configuration
is required. This is a situation where a Funtoo Linux machine will
require **multiple** network configurations. Funtoo Linux supports this.

The recommended approach for doing this is to use multiple, stacked runlevels.
To do this, you will need to create two new runlevels which are children
of the ``default`` runlevel. This can be done like this::

        # install -d /etc/runlevels/static
        # install -d /etc/runlevels/dynamic

Two new runlevels, ``static`` and ``dynamic``, have now been created.
Now, we will make these runlevels children of the ``default`` runlevel
using the following commands::

        # rc-update --stack add default static
        # rc-update --stack add default dynamic

Now, the runlevels ``static`` and ``dynamic`` will consist of anything
in ``default`` **plus** any additional scripts you add to each new
runlevel.

To complete our multiple network configuration, we would now do something
like this::

        # rc-update add netif.eth0 static
        # rc-update add dhcpcd dynamic

To switch to or between each runlevel, we would type::

	# rc static

Or::

	# rc dynamic

If we wanted to boot into ``dynamic`` by default, this could be
done by editing ``/etc/inittab`` and modifying this line::

	l3:3:wait:/sbin/rc default

To read as follows::

	l3:3:wait:/sbin/rc dynamic

Alternate Configs
-----------------

If you need to run the same service with different configuration parameters
depending upon runlevel, then you'll be happy to know that you can specify
runlevel-specific conf.d files by appending a ``.<runlevel>`` suffix. In this
particular example, we could imagine a situation where we had two child
runlevels named ``home`` and ``work``::

        /etc/conf.d/netif.eth0.home
        /etc/conf.d/netif.eth0.work

Note that this feature works for all init scripts, not just network
configuration scripts. 

Interface Renaming
------------------

The git version of corentwork now supports interface renaming, so you can
create an interface called ``lan`` if you would like. To so this, simply
specify the MAC address of the interface you would like to rename using
the ``macaddr`` variable::

        macaddr="00:15:17:19:b6:a3"

If this MAC address is part of the ``netif.lan`` configuration file, then when
this interface starts, whatever interface currently has the MAC address of
00:15:17:19:b6:a3 (i.e. ``eth5``) will be renamed to ``lan`` prior to the
interface being brought up, and will show up in ``ifconfig`` and ``ip``
commands as being an interface named ``lan``.

Basic VLAN Configuration
------------------------

The standard ``interface`` template supports VLANs. To use VLAN support, first
configure the trunk interface using the ``interface-noip`` template. Assuming
``eth1`` is trunked, you would create the file ``/etc/conf.d/netif.eth1`` with
the following contents::

        template="interface-noip"

Then, create a network interface symlink for the trunk and add it to your
default runlevel::

        # cd /etc/init.d
        # ln -s netif.tmpl netif.eth1
        # rc-update add netif.eth1 default

Now, assuming you wanted to configure a VLAN of 32, you would create a config
file named ``/etc/conf.d/netif.eth1.32`` that looks something like this::

        template="interface"
        ipaddr="1.2.3.4/24"
        gateway="1.2.3.1"
        # etc...

Then, create a VLAN network interface symlink and add it to your default
runlevel::

        # cd /etc/init.d
        # ln -s netif.tmpl netif.eth1.32
        # rc-update add netif.eth1.32 default

The Funtoo network configuration scripts will automatically recognize the
filename ``netif.eth1.32`` as being VLAN 32 of trunk interface
``netif.eth1``. 

When the VLAN interface is brought up, it will be named ``eth1.32``.

Custom VLAN Names
-----------------

However, sometimes you may want to turn off automatic file-based VLAN naming
and give your VLAN interface a custom name, such as ``mgmt``. To do this, you
would set up the trunk interface in the exact same way as described above,
but instead of creating a ``netif.eth1.32`` interface, you would create a
``netif.mgmt`` interface, and specify ``vlan`` and ``trunk`` in the
``/etc/conf.d/netif.mgmt`` config file, as follows::

        template="interface"
        vlan="32"
        trunk="eth1"
        ipaddr="1.2.3.4/24"
        gateway="1.2.3.1"
        # etc...

When you specify ``trunk`` and ``vlan`` in the interface config file,
filename-based auto-detecting of VLAN ID and trunk is disabled. 
Both ``trunk`` and ``vlan`` must be specified -- you can't specify just
one.

Then you would simply create a VLAN network interface symlink for
``netif.mgmt``::

        # cd /etc/init.d
        # ln -s netif.tmpl netif.mgmt
        # rc-update add netif.mgmt default

When the VLAN interface is brought up, it will be named ``mgmt``.

More Complex Network Configuration
----------------------------------

If the standard templates don't work for your needs, simply create a new
template -- I recommend starting from the ``interface`` template for most
things::

        # cd /etc/netif.d
        # cp interface custom

You can now call whatever commands you need to ``/etc/netif.d/custom``.
The following shell functions can be defined in a network script:

netif_depend
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In ``netif_depend``, you can define dependencies, using the functions
``need`` and ``use``.

netif_up_pre
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In ``netif_up_pre``, you can define network configuration actions to perform prior to bringing the interface up.
You can also ensure certain variables are specified by calling ``require var1 [var2...]`` here.

netif_up_post
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In ``netif_up_post``, you can define network configuration actions to perform after bringing the interface up.

netif_down_pre
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In ``netif_down_pre``, you can define network configuration actions to perform prior to bringing the interface down.

netif_down_post
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In ``netif_down_post``, you can define network configuration actions to perform after bringing the interface down.

How It Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You do not specify a function for actually bringing up the interface,
because the template-based system does this for you. The template-based
system also performs all normal actions for required for bringing an
interface down, so only need to specify atypical actions that must be
performed - such as removing child interfaces or destroying a bridge using
``brctl``. 

When you create your own network configuration template, the following
capabilities are available for use automatically, as long as the appropriate
variables are set in the ``/etc/conf.d/netif.<ifname>`` file,, without
requiring any explicit steps on your part:

- DNS configuration using ``domain`` and ``nameservers`` config settings. OpenResolv is used automatically.
- VLAN configuration using auto-naming (``netif.ethX.Y``) or via custom naming with ``trunk`` and ``vlan`` config settings.
- Default gateway configuration using the ``gateway`` setting.
- MTU configuration using the ``mtu`` setting.
- Auto-depend (and auto-MTU configuration) of slave interfaces specified using ``slaves`` setting. 
- Renaming of existing network interface (specify MAC address using ``macaddr`` setting).

To take advantage of this functionality, simply enable the appropriate variables.

All other necessary network configuration and dependency behavior should be
defined using the ``netif_``-prefix functions described above.

Wireless Configuration
======================

Wireless network configuration requires additional steps to the ones outlined
above.

For wireless networks, you will need to enable wireless extensions in
your kernel, the appropriate wireless modules, and emerge ``wireless-tools``::

        # emerge wireless-tools

I also recommend you ``emerge wpa_supplicant``.  ``wpa_supplicant`` implements
modern WPA/WPA2 wireless link-layer encryption, which is necessary for
connecting to most modern password-protected wireless networks.  After
emerging, add to your default runlevel as follows::

        # rc-update add wpa_supplicant default

802.11 Passphrases
------------------

The only remaining step is to use the ``wpa_passphrase`` utility to store
hashed keys (passwords) that ``wpa_supplicant`` can use to connect to your
favorite wireless networks. This is done as follows::

        # wpa_passphrase jims-netgear >> /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
        <enter your passphrase>

Now, when ``wpa_supplicant`` encounters an SSID of ``jims-netgear``, it will use
the password you entered to authenticate with this access point.

At this point, ensure that ``dhcpcd`` has been enabled in your current runlevel
and type ``rc`` to start everything up. ``wpa_supplicant`` should be able to
automatically associate with SSIDs in its config file, at which point ``dhcpcd``
will take over and acquire an IP address from a DHCP server. This should all
happen seamlessly. Use the ``iwconfig`` command to see if you have successfully
associated with an access point.

Wireless Firmware
-----------------

Many wireless adapters will now have everything they need to work. However,
if you have an Intel wireless adapter, then you may need to install the
proper microcode for your device in addition to ensuring that the proper Intel
Wireless kernel drivers are available. For my ``Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless
AGN [Shiloh] Network Connection``, I need to do the following::

        # emerge net-wireless/iwl5000-ucode

``udev`` (running by default) and the Linux kernel firmware loader support
(``CONFIG_FW_LOADER``) will automatically load the microcode when needed.

Note that Gentoo and Funtoo provide different versions of the Intel microcode
because the version you need will depend on the kernel you are using. For my
RHEL5-based kernel, I had emerge an older version of the microcode to match
what my kernel wireless driver was expecting by typing::

        # emerge =net-wireless/iwl5000-ucode-5.4.0.11

This installed this file ``iwlwifi-5000-1.ucode`` which was required by my
RHEL5-based kernel. Just typing ``emerge net-wireless-iwl5000-ucode`` installed
``iwlwifi-500-2.ucode``, which my kernel could not use. Before I had the
right version of the microcode, I saw an error like this when I viewed the
kernel messages by typing ``dmesg``::

        iwl5000: iwlwifi-5000-1.ucode firmware file req failed: Reason -2

This error message generally means "I can't find this file
*``iwlwifi-5000-1.ucode`` that I'm looking for in ``/lib/firmware``."* With the
proper firmware in place, then the wireless driver will be happy and
wpa-supplicant can then bring the wireless interface up.
